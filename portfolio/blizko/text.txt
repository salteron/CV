BLIZKO.ru is an online marketplace with tens of millions of products, tens of
thousands companies and up to thousand requests per minute.

The application is available in the Russian language only at https://www.blizko.ru
I translated several web pages from russian to english and made screenshots
for demonstration.

Requests per minute dynamics can be found at https://top.mail.ru/mdynamics?id=1384452&date=2019-07-12&period=0&lang=en

Being a server-side developer I designed and implemented business features of
different complexity. Such as users registration and authentication by phone
number. I extended the products ranking formula which defines the order they are
shown in listings. I added the ability to define traits for companies (price
category, payment options, etc), both manually and automatically assign their
values and filter companies by them in listings (faceted search). Deployed new
banner management system and switched application to use it.

I fixed critical problems with application stability and performance. I analyzed
and profiled database queries, optimized them, cleaned up database and tuned its
settings. This decreased server average response time from 500 ms to 300 ms and
eliminated daily downtime at the time of peak load.

I was among the very first who extracted components from monolithic application
into gems (packets) to be shared and reused by other teams. I planned and
performed complex deploys under load keeping the application up and running
without errors.

Application is monolithic. Server side is written in ruby programming language
with ruby on rails web framework. Postgresql acts as the main database
management system while redis, sphinx and memcached as supporting. Applications
run under linux OS. Capistrano and its web-interface webistrano are used to
deploy. RSpec is used for unit tests.
