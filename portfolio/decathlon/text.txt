As a member of a custom development team in "SKB Kontur" company I took an active
part in every development stage from inception to completion of the web
application which is an electronic documents management system for the russian
branch of Decathlon company.

It is used to upload, store, approve and sign documents with electronic
signatures. It integrates with client's systems such as SAP SuccessFactors to
import documents, human resource management system to import users and with SKB
Kontur internal systems intended to issue and renew public key certificates,
generate cloud based digital signatures and documents' print forms. There are
tens of thousands of new documents annually.

I implemented key features such as signing documents in a number of different
ways, public key certificates issue and renewal. I contributed to integrations
with all external systems and to users authentication/authorization system.
I wrote and reviewed server-side and client-side code, unit and integration
tests. Now I take part in support of the application which involves bug-fixing,
performing security and components updates.

Server side is written in ruby programming language with ruby on rails web
framework. Client side is written in javascript with jquery and react libraries.
Postgresql acts as the main database management system and redis as supporting.
Applications run under linux OS. Docker is used to organize development
environment. Capistrano and its web-interface samson are used to deploy. Rspec
is used for unit tests and cucumber for acceptance tests.

The application has been translated from russian to english and populated with
fake data for demonstration. Public access to the web site is restricted.
