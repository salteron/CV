As a member of a custom development team in "SKB Kontur" company I took an
active part in development of the web application which allows to submit
applications for bank services. Clients are welcome to submit applications,
attach documents and sign them with electronic signatures. Agents assist clients
in doing that. Bank employees review, approve or reject applications. The
software heavily integrates with electronic documents flow system named Diadoc
(by SKB Kontur) via its API to pass documents and signatures between parties.
Thousands of applications are submitted through the site every year.

I implemented user authentication and authorization features. As well as
interactive way of attaching documents (files) to applications, documents
signature, external APIs integrations and submission of advance applications
from promo site. I wrote both server-side and client-side code. Now I take part
in support of the application which involves bug-fixing, performing security and
components updates.

Server side is written in ruby programming language with ruby on rails web
framework. Client side is written in JavaScript with jQuery and react libraries.
PostgreSQL acts as the main database management system and Redis as supporting.
Applications run under Linux OS. Docker is used to organize development
environment. Capistrano and its web-interface Samson are used to deploy. RSpec
is used for unit tests and cucumber for acceptance tests.

The application is available via invitation and in the Russian language only at
https://bg.kontur.ru/pskb. You can have a look at it's populated with fake data
UI on translated from russian to english screenshots.
